<b>[Low Interest Rates and Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows](http://lichengzh.github.io/files/low.pdf)</b> (JMP)<br> 
Abstract: This paper studies the effect of monetary policy on investors' asset allocation decisions by using data on aggregated and disaggregated mutual fund flows. First, we find that following an expansionary monetary policy, both equity funds and bond funds receive large inflows.
Specific to asset classes, investors move money from large-cap assets to mid-cap and small-cap assets in the near term and then shift assets from domestic to developed and emerging markets. This suggests that equity investors become more risk-taking when the interest rate is low. In contrast, bond investors become more risk-averse and move money into highly safe investment-grade funds. Moreover, we offer empirical evidence that the Fed's long-lasting zero lower bound policy has a much greater impact on bond investors than equity investors, although it leads to even more risk-taking for both investors. <br>

<b>[Monetary Policy, Financial Conditions and GDP at Risk](http://lichengzh.github.io/files/fci.pdf)</b> <br> 
Abstract: In this paper, we empirically explore the interrelationship between monetary policy, financial conditions, and GDP growth based on cross-country panel data. Specifically, we estimate impulse responses of financial conditions to monetary policy, GDP growth distribution to financial conditions, and GDP growth to short-term interest rates through the smooth local projections. We apply the penalized quantile regression with fixed effects method to estimate the GDP growth distribution. Our results suggest that the financial conditions play a central role in the monetary policy transmission and offer a reliable signal to the entire GDP growth distribution, especially on the tail outcomes. However, not all financial variables show these effects.
In addition, we find that the short-term interest rate has a strong effect on the average GDP growth, but its effect on the entire GDP growth distribution is very limited. <br>
