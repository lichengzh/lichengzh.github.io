<b>[Low Interest Rates and Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows](http://lichengzh.github.io/files/JMP.pdf)</b> (Job Market Paper)<br> 
Abstract: This paper studies the effect of monetary policy on investors' asset allocation decisions by using data on aggregated and disaggregated mutual fund flows. First, we find that following an expansionary monetary policy, both equity funds and bond funds receive large inflows. Specific to asset classes, investors move money from large-cap assets to mid-cap and small-cap assets in the near term and then shift assets from domestic to developed and emerging markets. This leads us to the hypothesis that equity investors become more risk-taking when the interest rate is low, we then test this with individual funds panel data, our results indeed confirm this hypothesis. By contrast, bond investors become more risk-averse and move money into highly safe investment-grade funds and diversified global funds. Furthermore, we offer empirical evidence that the Fed's long-lasting zero lower bound policy (ZLB) increases both equity investors' and bond investors' appetite for risk-taking, although it has a much greater impact on bond investors than equity investors. Bond investors change from being risk-averse during the normal interest rate period to  become risk-taking during the ZLB period. <br>

<b>Monetary Policy, Financial Conditions and GDP at Risk</b> <br> 
Abstract: We empirically explore the interrelationship between monetary policy, financial conditions, and GDP growth based on cross-country panel data. Specifically, we apply the penalized quantile regression with fixed effects method to estimate the GDP growth distribution, and estimate impulse responses of financial conditions to monetary policy, GDP growth distribution to financial conditions, and short-term interest rates through the smooth local projections. Our results suggest that the financial conditions play an important role in monetary policy transmission and offer a strong signal on the tail outcomes of GDP growth. However, when considering specific financial conditions variables: credit to households, debt securities, effective exchange rate, and open-end fund total asset, only credit to households show a consistently positive effect on near-term GDP at risk. In addition, we find that the short-term interest rate has a strong effect on the average GDP growth, but its effect on the quantiles of GDP growth is much smaller. <br>
